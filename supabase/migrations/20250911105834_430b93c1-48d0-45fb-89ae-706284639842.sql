-- SECURITY FIX: Proper RLS policies for manager profiles to protect all derived views
-- Views inherit RLS from underlying tables, so we need comprehensive policies on manager_profiles

-- Drop existing policies to recreate them with better security

-- This allows public views but excludes sensitive contact/business data through view column selection

ON public.manager_profiles 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
    status = 'approved' 
    AND company_name IS NOT NULL

-- Policy 2: Authenticated users can access business information (for managers_business_info view)
-- This provides access to sensitive business data like assets_under_management

FOR SELECT 
USING (
    status = 'approved'
