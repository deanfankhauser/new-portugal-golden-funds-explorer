                The Portugal Golden Visa Program is a residency-by-investment scheme that allows non-EU nationals to obtain 
                residency permits in Portugal by making a qualifying investment in the country. One of the qualifying 
                investment options is investing in regulated investment funds focused on the capitalization of companies.

                funds, private equity funds, and other regulated investment funds that meet the specific requirements set by

              <AccordionContent className="text-gray-600 pt-4">
                Golden Visa holders are required to spend a minimum of just 7 days in Portugal during the first year, 
                and 14 days in subsequent periods of two years. This is significantly lower than other residency programs, 
                making it attractive for investors who cannot or do not wish to relocate permanently.

                The process typically takes between 6-12 months from the time of investment until the residence permit 
                is issued. However, this can vary based on the current application volume and individual circumstances. 
                The investment must be completed before the residency application is submitted.

                Portuguese citizenship. Requirements include passing a basic Portuguese language test (A2 level) and 
                demonstrating links to the country. Portugal allows dual citizenship, which is an attractive feature 
                for many investors.
